# FEtalk
A forum for Front-End technologies sharing and it is just a practice for my study of Front-End.
So its UI and main functionality come from the existed [f2e.im](http://www.f2e.im),but I also add some small functionality,
such as the "concern somebody" and "send private letter",the detail information can be obtained from the "read.md" file.
# Usage
Just run the "setup.php",and enter the basic information of your mysql server,I did not test it on remote host,but it works
well on [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/zh_cn/index.html)
